# 🎲 ArbFinder: Arbitrage Bot for Probo & Polymarket

> 🚧 **Side Quest Project** — Exploring the mechanics of opinion markets and the possibility of guaranteed profit through arbitrage.

## 🧠 Overview

**ArbFinder** is a research-driven tool designed to identify arbitrage opportunities between two popular opinion-based gambling platforms: [Probo](https://probo.in) and [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com). It analyzes market discrepancies and helps place offsetting bets on both platforms to lock in a **guaranteed profit**, regardless of the outcome.

This project is not intended to promote gambling, but rather to explore the underlying dynamics of prediction markets and how pricing inefficiencies can be leveraged.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Market Scraping**: Fetches real-time odds and market data from Probo and Polymarket.
2. **Arbitrage Detection**: Compares prices to identify mismatches where betting on both sides yields a profit.
3. **Bet Placement Logic**: Calculates optimal stake distribution to ensure profit regardless of the result.
4. **Profit Estimation**: Displays expected returns and risk-free profit margins.

## 📈 Example

Suppose:
- Probo offers 60% odds on "Team A wins"
- Polymarket offers 45% odds on "Team A loses"

ArbFinder detects that betting appropriately on both sides can yield a net profit due to the pricing gap.
