# 🎲 ArbFinder: Arbitrage Bot for Probo & Polymarket

> This project began as a **Side Quest Project** to understand:

How prediction markets derive their odds

Whether efficient market hypothesis holds in these platforms

The mechanics of cross-platform arbitrage

It's not about gambling, but about exploring market microstructure and behavioral economics.

## 🧠 Overview

**ArbFinder** is a research-driven tool designed to identify arbitrage opportunities between two popular opinion-based gambling platforms: [Probo](https://probo.in) and [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com). It analyzes market discrepancies and helps place offsetting bets on both platforms to lock in a **guaranteed profit**, regardless of the outcome.

This project is not intended to promote gambling, but rather to explore the underlying dynamics of prediction markets and how pricing inefficiencies can be leveraged.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Market Scraping**: Fetches real-time odds and market data from Probo and Polymarket.
2. **Arbitrage Detection**: Compares prices to identify mismatches where betting on both sides yields a profit.
3. **Bet Placement Logic**: Calculates optimal stake distribution to ensure profit regardless of the result.
4. **Profit Estimation**: Displays expected returns and risk-free profit margins.

## 📈 Example

Suppose:
- Probo offers 60% odds on "Team A wins"
- Polymarket offers 45% odds on "Team A loses"

ArbFinder detects that betting appropriately on both sides can yield a net profit due to the pricing gap.

## 🙅‍♂️ Disclaimer: I'm a Coder, Not a Gambler 🎩💻

Let’s get one thing straight:

> 🧑‍💻 I’m not a gambler — I’m a software engineer with a curious mind and a knack for spotting patterns.

This project is my way of poking around the world of opinion markets using code, not chips. I’m just applying my engineering skills to explore whether **math + market inefficiencies = money**.

So while this tool might sniff out arbitrage opportunities, it’s not an invitation to gamble. I don’t support gambling, and I strongly advise against it. This is a **side quest**, not a casino heist. 🎮

Use responsibly. Learn deeply. Code boldly.
