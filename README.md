# 🎲 ArbFinder: Probo ↔ Polymarket Arbitrage Finder

> 💡 *A data-driven side quest to explore the mechanics of opinion markets, betting asymmetries, and platform inefficiencies — **not** a guide to gambling.*

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**ArbQuest** is a lightweight tool that detects arbitrage opportunities between two popular opinion platforms: [Probo](https://probo.in) and [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com).  
It automatically scans live events, compares odds, and calculates profitable scenarios where **placing opposing bets on both platforms** guarantees a profit — irrespective of the outcome.

This is not a betting engine — it's a window into how **market sentiment**, **behavioral pricing**, and **platform inefficiencies** play out in the real world.

---
## 🧠 Why This Exists

This project started as a **personal side quest** into how opinion-based platforms operate.  
Platforms like **Probo** and **Polymarket** allow users to express beliefs about real-world outcomes.  
But when crowd sentiment diverges across platforms, **can that disagreement be used to hedge perfectly and guarantee profit?**

---

### ❓ Key Questions Explored

- 📉 **Does the Efficient Market Hypothesis apply to opinion markets?**  
  Are these platforms truly efficient, or do they allow pricing anomalies?

- 🔄 **Can cross-platform price discrepancies be systematically identified?**  
  Is there a repeatable way to detect and capitalize on mismatched odds?

- 👨‍💻 **What tools are needed to test and exploit those inefficiencies safely?**  
  From APIs to smart contracts, what infrastructure is required for real-time arbitrage?

---
> 💬 Think of it as **financial spelunking** — but with a keyboard instead of a pickaxe.

## 🙅‍♂️ Disclaimer: I'm a Coder, Not a Gambler 🎩💻

Let’s get one thing straight:

🧑‍💻 I’m *not* a gambler — I’m a software engineer with a curious mind and a knack for spotting patterns.  
This project is my way of poking around the world of **opinion markets** using **code**, not chips.

I’m just applying my engineering skills to explore whether:  
**math + market inefficiencies = money?**

---

So while this tool might sniff out arbitrage opportunities between platforms like **Probo** and **Polymarket**,  
⚠️ **it is *not* an invitation to gamble.**

I do **not** support gambling, and I **strongly advise against it**.

This is a side quest — not a casino heist. 🎮  
Use responsibly. Learn deeply. Code boldly.
